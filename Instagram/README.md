# Instagram Copy app
# 
**Objective:** Learn to use Parse and Heroku to create a large scale app.  Additionally, combine all the skills I've learned from the previous apps

**Description:** A copy of the instagram app.  Includes login and signup features.  When logged in you are presented with a list of users and you can tap on a user's name to follow them.  A checkmark appears next to the user you are following.  To add photos go to the post tab and it will lead to a view that allows you to select photos from your photo library and then you are prompted to write a message.  To view your instagram feed go to the feed tab.


NOTE: APP IS STILL IN PRODUCTION 

Usage to access Parse Dashboard: parse-dashboard --appId insta1234567890asdlfj --masterKey 23456as7dgfsa0dg80as --serverURL "http://instagg.herokuapp.com/parse" --appName Instagram
